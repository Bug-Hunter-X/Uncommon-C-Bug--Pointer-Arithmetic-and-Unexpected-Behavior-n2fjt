This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in C programming related to pointer arithmetic and how it can lead to unexpected results.  The `bug.c` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version and explains the underlying issue.  The bug involves using pointers to manipulate memory.  Incorrect pointer arithmetic or attempts to access memory outside the allocated boundaries can result in segmentation faults, data corruption, or undefined behavior. The solution illustrates how to properly handle pointers to ensure correct and safe memory management.
